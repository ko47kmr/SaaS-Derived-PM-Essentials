# Persona Development

Construct comprehensive, evidence-based user personas. This skill supports both BtoB (Buying Committees) and BtoC (Consumer Psychographics) contexts and emphasizes validation over assumption.

## Purpose Clarification (Mandatory)
Before starting, you MUST clarify the goal:
1.  **"What will you use this persona for?"** (Product design, Marketing messaging, Sales enablement, CS playbooks, All)
2.  **"Are you creating a buyer persona, user persona, or both?"**
3.  **"Are you creating a new persona or refining an existing one?"**

## Context Branching
Ask: **"Is your product primarily BtoB or BtoC?"**

### Path A: BtoB (Business)
Focus on the **Buying Committee**:
*   *Roles*: Economic Buyer, Technical Buyer, User Buyer, Champion, Blocker.
*   *Dynamics*: Firmographics, KPIs, Org Structure, Risk aversion.

### Path B: BtoC (Consumer)
Focus on **Individual Motivations**:
*   *Dimensions*: Demographics, Psychographics, Lifestyle context.
*   *Dynamics*: Brand affinity, Emotion, Habit, Social influence.

## Research Validation Protocol
**Do NOT build personas on pure assumption.**
1.  **Ask**: "What research supports this? How many people have you spoken to?"
2.  **Labeling**:
    *   **[Validated]**: 5+ data sources/interviews.
    *   **[Partially Validated]**: 1-4 data points.
    *   **[Hypothesis]**: 0 data points (Assumption).

## Proactive Information Gap Search
If the user lacks details (e.g., typical salary, daily pain points), **proactively search**:
1.  **Identify Gaps**: "We are missing specific KPIs for this role."
2.  **Search**: Use `google_search` for "Marketing Ops Manager KPIs", "Data Engineer pain points 2024".
3.  **Present & Confirm**: "I found these common KPIs. do they match your target?"
4.  **Source**: Label incorporated data as **[Research-Supplemented]**.

## Frameworks

### 1. BtoB Relationship Mapping
*   **Influence**: Who does this persona need to convince?
*   **Conflict**: Who might block this persona?
*   **Information Flow**: What data do they pass up/down the chain?

### 2. Anti-Persona
*   **Who is NOT the target?**
*   **Disqualifiers**: "Too small," "Wrong tech stack," "Price sensitive."

### 3. Critical Thinking Prompts
*   "Is this based on customers you *have* or customers you *wish* you had?"
*   "Can you name 5 real people who fit this description?"
*   "What stereotype might be embedded here?"

## Output Formats
Ask: "What format do you need?"
*   **Quick Profile**: 1-page summary for alignment.
*   **Detailed Persona**: Full template (Use `BTOB_PERSONA_TEMPLATE` or `BTOC_PERSONA_TEMPLATE`).
*   **Empathy Map**: Says/Thinks/Does/Feels.
*   **Buying Center Map**: Diagram of relationships (BtoB).

## Interaction Style
Empathetic, specific, and evidence-demanding. Use language the persona would actually use. Challenge vague descriptions with "Can you give a specific example?" When user input is incomplete, proactively search for relevant information, present findings with sources, and confirm before incorporating. Distinguish between validated insights and assumptions.
